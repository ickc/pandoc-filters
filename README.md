An experiment on cataloging pandoc filters. The spreadsheet is hosted on [pandoc-filters - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eqMwPyxT0rN3z_tXpsISGBys0QR25W0x-tYDRsFBKAE/edit#gid=829695967). It is then exported to `pandoc-filters.csv` in this repository.

Many of pandoc filters can be found in [Pandoc Filters Â· jgm/pandoc Wiki](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-Filters).

The idea is that the data can be transformed into a gallery later, something like [this](http://macappstore.org/pandoc-2/), that eases the discovery process, and from there the instruction of installation too.
